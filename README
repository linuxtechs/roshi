500px DevOps Coding Challenge

- Ansible will be used to complete this challenge

Req:

- Ubuntu 14.04
- check your solution into Github

The Challenge:

- A single instance of Roshi server 
- A single instance of Redis server 
- An HTTP proxy server in front of Roshi 

Test the result:

- roshi­server ­redis.instances=localhost:6379

criteria must be met:  
 
- Roshi server is running, and the process is supervised. 
- Redis server is running, and the process is supervised. 
- The proxy server is running, and the process is supervised. 
- Roshi is accessible from any IP in the 172.31.32.x  subnet on  port 80 . It is not 
accessible from any IP outside that subnet. 
- The solution is idempotent and convergent. This means that it does everything it needs 
to do on the first run, and it can be run over and over without consequence or race 
conditions.
